# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

## Yeah I have completed the setup let me share this with everyone:-

To setting up a local environment:-

1. Download and install Docker from <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">install docker</a>.
2. Then check the version, docker -v and docker-compose -v in command prompt.
3. Open the GitHub repo of Anything <a href="https://github.com/ObelusFamily/Anythink-Market-6wou1">Anything repo</a> and clone it in local.
4. Open terminal and go to the cloned folder then run "docker-compose up".
5. Then run this link on browser "to http://localhost:3000/api/ping".
6. And now try to run frontend "http://localhost:3001/register" and create user.
